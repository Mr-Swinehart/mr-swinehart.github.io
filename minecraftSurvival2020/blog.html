        <p>Biff! Biff, where're you going now? I told you Grandma, I'm going to the dance! When are you coming home? The dance! He's a peeping tom.  Dad!  Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you?  Stella, another one of these kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Unroll their fire. Doc, wait.  Go. Go. Definitely, although not for another 84 years and not on trains. We'll have space vehicles ... capsules to sail off in rockets - devices that create giant explosions...explosions that are so...powerful that they...  ...they break the pull of the earth's gravity and send their projectile through outer space. </p>

        <p>Emmett...I read that book too. You're quoting Jules Verne, From The Earth To The Moon. You've read Jules Verne? I adore Jules Verne. So do I. 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, my absolute favorite. The first time I read that when I was a little boy I wanted to meet Captain Nemo and... Look Lorraine, you walk out that door, I'll not only cut off you, I'll cut off your kids! </p>

        <p>You wouldn't! Oh, wouldn't I? First your daughter Linda, I'll cancel all her credit cards. She can settle her debts with the bank all by herself.  Your idiot son, Dave, I'll get his parole revoked. And as for Marty, well, maybe you'd like all three of your kids behind bars just like your brother Joey. One big happy jailbird family.

        </p>
   
        <p>Catch you on the block side, </p>
