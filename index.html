    <p>I introduced web design in 2014 as a part of the Computer curriculum.  Not having any real background in these areas and wanting to add more graphic design type assignments, I found Khan Academy.  We started out with Javascript, which was a struggle for me and some of the students.  Once we got into HTML and CSS, things began to click a little more.  
    
        <br><br>
        
    The first two years were fairly good.  The students were picking up on things fairly quickly and doing well.  I, then, found out about Bootstrap!  Bootstrap took the design aspect for students and made it a million times easier to layout and create websites.  Every year, the students get a little more brave and bolder with what they are creating.  This is one of those topics that I go crazy over.  There is so much potential with these skills
        
        <br><br>
        
        
    Every year, I build a website with the students.  This helps keep my skills honed as best as possible, but also lets the students see how things work will designing a webiste.  You will find the list of websites I have worked on below. I've made more than this.  The problem is the computer I had saved them to died... completely... Hard drive and all.  So at this moment, I don't have very many.

    <p class="work">Although we moved a few times, I grew up in Durand, Michigan. If you're not familiar with that portion of the country, it's right between Lansing and Flint (both of those cities have been in the news at some point over the last few years).  I went to a small school in a farming community known as Byron. My graduation class had 88 people in it.
    
    <br><br>
    
        Feeling God wanted me to work in Youth Ministry, I went to Pensacola Christian College in Florida.  After two years there, I transferred to a local community college until I could figure out where I wanted to go to finish my degree.  I finalized my decision on Clarks Summit University in Clarks Summit, PA (seems ironic doesn't it). Wrapped up my degree, got married, moved to West Virginia... and that's where I've been.
            
    <br><br>
            
    After looking for work, I finally found a job and started working in a factory that printed magazines for big companies &#40;like Cabela's and National Geographic&#41;.  A few years later, a job opportunity opened at a local Christian school and I was hired as the middle and high school Bible teacher. As time wore on, some shifting of personel happened and I was asked to be the middle and high school computer teacher.  This question did not come by chance since I was attempting to use technology in my classroom as much as I could.  
    
    <br><br>
    
    When I took over the classes, the previous teacher had students use Khan Academy for programming.  It was then that I became really interested in the abilities of building websites.  I bought a couple of online classes and dove in.  Ever since then, I decided to have my students at least learn how to build a website with HTMl and CSS.  I've always been a little shaky on Javascript... but who hasn't, right?
        
    <br><br>
        
    After a few years, I discovered the ability to post your website to Github for free... which, as a teacher, is AWESOME!  So we started adding our websites to Github last year so family and friends could see them.  It's been really awesome!  Every year, the students continue to improve and build amazing websites.
    
        <br><br>
        
    And this is where I've landed.  I'm upset that my past websites don't exist today.  I will continue to search for them, but I love doing this project with my students.
