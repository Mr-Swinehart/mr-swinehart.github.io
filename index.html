    <p class="text-left work">After I graduated from college, I started off working in a factory that printed magazines for big companies &#40;like Cabela's and National Geographic&#41;.  A job opportunity opened at a local Christian school and I was hired as the middle and high school Bible teacher.  
    
       
        
    As time wore on, some shifting of personel happened and I was asked to be the middle and high school computer teacher.  This question did not come by chance since I was attempting to use technology in my classroom as much as I could.  
    
    <br><br>
    
    When I took over the classes, the previous teacher had students use Khan Academy for programming.  It was then that I became really interested in the abilities of building websites.  I bought a couple of online classes and dove in.  Ever since then, I decided to have my students at least learn how to build a website with HTMl and CSS.  I've always been a little shaky on Javascript... but who hasn't, right?
        
    <br><br>
        
    After a few years, I discovered the ability to post your website to Github for free... which, as a teacher, is AWESOME!  So we started adding our websites to Github last year so family and friends could see them.  It's been really awesome!  Every year, the students continue to improve and build amazing websites.
    
        <br><br>
        
    And this is where I've landed.  I'm upset that my past websites don't exist today.  I will continue to search for them, but I love doing this project with my students.  I hope you enjoy checking out these websites.  If so, drop me a line on twitter.
