(He spots his Seamus standing in front of the Saloon. Seamus grins and rolls his hands into fists, faking a punch to show that he saw what Marty did.) Seamus! (Marty tosses him the gun and gun belt.) Worth $12, never been used. Maybe I'll trade it for a new hat. Right, and take care of that baby! (He rides off with Doc toward the train.)Hook on! (The gang connect their hoverboards to Griff's. Marty is trying to move, he's pushing his foot in the water as if trying to start a skateboard.) Batter up! (The board blasts off. Griff and his gang are on the way! Marty tries pushing the board again, but it doesn't work. Griff is getting closer. Then, just as Griff would have got Marty, Marty jumps off the board and lands in the water. Griff's board catches on a rock and Griff and his gang all fall off. They fly through the air and smash through the front window of Courthouse Mall. Marty resurfaces.) Holy shit! (He grabs the hoverboard and gets out of the water. Cut to Biff.) Buttheads.

               No, no, no, Doc, I just got here, OK, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? No, no, no, no, no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids! (The DeLorean)</p>

                C'mon, Doc, let's go. (they move to leave) Are you comin' out here, runt, or do I have to go in there after ya? (Doc and Marty escape out the back door and go down the stairs into an alley.) The thing I really miss here is Tylenol. (A gang member wanders over to check the alley and spots them.)</p>
