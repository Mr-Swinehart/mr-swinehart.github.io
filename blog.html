They are now safe on the hoverboard. YES!No Mom; Mom, mom, mom, calm down, I wasn't yelling... Needles and I were just kinda joking. Welcome home Jennifer.  I'm young!Mom, is that you? There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. 1955?  You're my mo…you're my mo….

How fast she can go? Why, I've powered her up to 55 myself. I hear that fearless Frank Fargo got one of these up to near 70 out past Verde Junction. Is it possible to get it up to 90? Laughing. 90? Tarnations, son, why'd ya ever be in such a hurry? Well, it's just a little bet that he and I have, that's all. Theoretically speaking, could it be done?</p>

                <p> Right. Let's go Einie.  Don't worry, she'll be fine.  I don't remember bars being on these windows.Look, Doc, what's the worst that could happen, huh? So they don't name the ravine after her. Let's just get the Delorean ready and get the hell out of here. I wish I'd never invented that infernal time machine...it's caused nothing but disaster. When's the next train coming through here? Monday morning at 8 o'clock.  This spur runs off the main line 3 miles down to Clayton Ravine. There's a long stretch of track that will still exist in 1985. This is where we'll push the DeLorean with the locomotive. Funny, this map calls Clayton ravine Shonash Ravine. Must be an old Indian name for it. It's perfect. Nice long run that goes clear across the bridge over the ravine, you know, over near that Hilldale housing development. Right, Doc, but according to this map...indicating map...there is no bridge.

               Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Yeah, sure, okay. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. 
                
                <br>
                <br>
                    So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Excuse me. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Uh, coast guard. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Where's the book? I dunno, Biff must still have it with him, all I have is the cover.  But where's Biff?

No, Biff, you leave her alone. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it.  Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop.Watch where you're going, crazy drunk pedestrian! Red! There is a toxic plant in the Square and a tank owned by the Hill Valley Police is driving around. Marty looks at the Courthouse. It's now a high rise building. The clock has been removed and extra stories have been built on top. Then Marty gets the biggest surprise - it is now BIFF TANNEN'S PLEASURE PARADISE!!! A neon image of Biff using a money bill as a cigar can be seen. At the top of the building is the word "Biff's" in big neon letters. Big chimneys are also polluting the air.
