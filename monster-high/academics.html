    <p>That's Mrs. McFly, and don't you be forgettin' the misses! And what might your name be sir? Well, it's Mc…(he stops suddenly realizing that he shouldn't tell her his real name.) Eastwood...uh...Clint...Clint Eastwood? (grins sheepishly) You hit your head, Mr. Eastwood. Not too serious, but lucky for you, Seamus found you when he did. Seamus? Me husband. You'll be excuse me Mr. East-wood, while I tend to William.(Blast from the Past) (Marty walks over to the Antique store and looks in the window. Inside are ‘Grey’s Sports Almanac 1950-2000, a JAWS Nintendo game, a Roger Rabbit doll, a lava lamp, a Dustbuster, a walkman, Animal House & Dragnet videos, and Marty’s shirt and jacket from Part I.) </p>
        <p>
        (Café 80’s) (Marty walks in and we see that this is where Lou’s Café was in 1955. ‘Beat It’ by Michael Jackson is playing in the background. The layout of the café is still basically the same as it was in 1955. Behind the counter are several TV’s playing shows of the 1980’s such as Family Ties, Dallas, Cheers, The Smurfs, and Taxi. Biff, now an old man, is seen in the background. Neither he nor Marty see each other. The café is decorated with various 80’s style decorations. Two people are riding on exercise bikes. Instead of waiters, there are video waiters. One of them, who looks like Michael Jackson, is talking to a women who is sitting at the counter.) "Michael Jackson"…it's got a hot salsa, avocados, some natural mixture with your choice of beans, chicken, b..b..beef or pork.....</p>

    <p>Thanks, thanks a lot. (Parking Lot) You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. (Biff shoves her down, and George watches in horror. George then doubles up his fist when Biff isn't looking and when Biff looks back George decks him. Biff falls down and is out cold. George can't believe what he did. Then he holds out a hand to Loraine.) Are you okay?</p>
        <p>
        I'm young! I'm old! (Both faint, but luckily Doc is there to catch 1985 Jennifer.) (Outside) (Biff arrives back in 2015 and parks the DeLorean. He gets out, clutching his chest. Doc calls to Marty.)(Main Street) (Marty hits 88 MPH and disappears into the future.) Yeah!! (Main Street - 1985) Crazy drunk drivers.</p>

    <h3>Mathmatics</h3>
        <p>This says September 1st, 1885. I never knew I could write anything so touching. Standing up and going over to Doc. I know, I know Doc, it's beautiful. (Copernicus whines.) Oh, it's all right, Copernicus! Everything's going to be fine. I'm sorry, Doc, it's all my fault you're stuck back there. I never should've let Biff get to me.</p>
        <p>It's dawg, Buford. Shoot 'im down like a dawg. (Tannen gets flustered but doesn't want to admit that he messed up.) Let's go, boys! Let these sissies have their party! (They quickly leave, and Doc pulls Marty aside.) Marty, what are you doing, saying you're going to meet Tannen?</p>

    <h3>English &amp; Literature</h3>
        <p>Marty...uh, Clint...I'm going to take Clara home. (Before Marty can reply he's pulled aside by another man.) You sure set him straight, Mr. Eastwood. I'm glad somebody finally got the gumption to stand up to that son-of-a-biscuit. You're alright in my book, Mr. Eastwood...I'd like to buy you a drink. Hey, look, I don't want a drink. It was no big deal.</p>
        <p>It's dawg, Buford. Shoot 'im down like a dawg. (Tannen gets flustered but doesn't want to admit that he messed up.) Let's go, boys! Let these sissies have their party! (They quickly leave, and Doc pulls Marty aside.) Marty, what are you doing, saying you're going to meet Tannen?(v.o) Drying mode on. Jacket drying. (beep) Your jacket is now dry. (Marty walks over to the girls he borrowed the hoverboard from.) Hey kid, little girl, thanks. Keep it, I've got a Pit Bull now. Come on.</p>

    <h3>Science</h3>
        <p>You can do it! Just don't look down...that's it! (Clara slowly makes her way out of the engine car.) (into walkie-talkie) Sixty miles an hour, Doc!! (to Clara) You're doing fine! Nice and steady! Come on! Just a little further! (All the while Clara is moving closer to him, climbing on the edge of the train.) I can't Emmett, I'm scared!</p>
        <p>(sarcastically into walkie-talkie) Perfect. (Clara manages to get off her horse and onto the end of the train.) (into walkie-talkie) Hey, Doc, we just hit 35! (into walkie-talkie) Okay, Marty, I'm coming aboard! (He begins to climb out to the Delorean)All right then. I'm from the future. (Clara looks at him in disbelief.) I came here in a time machine that I invented and tomorrow I have to go back to the year 1985. (getting angry) Yes, Emmett, I do understand. (Doc looks relieved, not realizing that she's not done yet.) I understand that because you know I'm partial to the writings of Jules Verne you concocted those mendacities in order to take advantage of me! (She slaps Doc on the cheek.) Oh, I've heard some whoppers in my day but the fact that you'd expect me to entertain a notion like that is so...insulting and degrading! All you had to say is "I don't love you and I don't want to see you anymore." That at least would've been respectful! (She slams the door.) But that's not the truth! (Doc, removes the flower from his suit that Clara has given him and leaves it on the window sill next to her doorway. He leaves. Through the window we see Clara run into the room and bury her face on the bed, crying.) (Saloon)</p>

    <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I am here, and it does make sense. I came back to 1955 with the you from 1985 to get a book back from Biff. So once we got the book back, you...that is the you from 1985...were in the Delorean when it got struck by lightning and you got sent back to 1885! 1885? Opens door. It's a very interesting story, Future Boy, but there's one little thing that doesn't make sense. If the me in the future is now in the past, how could you possibly know about it? You sent me a letter. (holds up the letter.) (Doc's Workshop) (A few minutes later)</p>
        <p>(Biff gets out of the DeLorean. The top of his cane breaks off and stays in there.) Oh, oh, ahh! (Marty and Doc are running down the street carrying Jennifer.) She encountered her future self and went into shock, just as I predicted. She'll be fine - lets get her back to 1985. And then I'm going to destroy the time machine! Destroy it? What about all that stuff about humanity? Where we're going and why?Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday… Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Uh, no, no, no, no. (Notices that Marty is watching them.) What are you looking at, butt-head?</p>

        <p>(o.s) Let's do another one! Where'd he go? He just came in here? (o.s) Something that really cooks. (3-D spots 1955 Marty on the stage about to play Johnny B Goode.) 3-Look. How'd he get up on stage?C'mon, Doc, c'mon...wake up, buddy. C'mon, wake up, Doc, c'mon, c'mon. Seamus. Wouldn't expect to see you here this morning. Aye. But something inside me told me I should be 'ere. As if my future had something to do with it. (Marty turns for a moment and stares at Seamus. Then the bartender speaks, snapping him back to the task at hand.) He'll come around in a minute.</p>
        <p>Get the boards! Get McFly! (Marty is almost getting the hang of the hoverboard - until he almost bumps into some people and rocks.) Argh! (he falls off the hoverboard) Get him!</p>

    <h3>Technology</h3>
    
        <p>(w.t) On the roof, 10-4. (Marty turns the corner to meet up with Biff's gang.) 3-Hey, it's him! And he's in disguise! Guys, what's that?I know, I know Doc! (Doc puts the almanac on a barrel and the two leave. Unknown to them, Biff has been overhearing! He opens a door to see the almanac and picks it up.) So, Doc Brown invented a time machine. (Hilldale) (The police car arrives. The signs outside say "Hilldale - The Address Of Success" but have been altered to say "The Address Of Suckers". The car lands outside a house and the officers open the door.) Hilldale. Nothing but a breeding ground for tranqs, lobos and zipheads.</p>
        <p>Doc, wait. (The Libyans corner Doc and shoot him.) No!! Bastards!! (They go after him and he jumps in the Delorean and takes off.) Go. Go. (they follow) C'mon, more, dernit. Jeez. Holy shooot. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. (floors the gas, and as soon as the car reaches 88 MPH he is sent back to 1955.)</p>

                <p>(Marty's House) (Doc has dropped Marty off.) About how far ahead are you going? About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47.</p>
