                    <p>I'll get him Doc. Copernicus!  Come on, let's go home, boy.  What's wrong? What's wrong, Copernicus, come on, let's go home. Come on. Will you take care of that? Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. What?</p>
                    
                    <p>Hiyah! Ready to roll! Emmett, when my bags were thrown from the wagon, my telescope was damaged. And since you expressed an interest...in science, I thought you might be able to repair it for me.  I would pay you, of course. Oh, no, no, no, I wouldn't think of charging you for this.  Well, let's have a look at it.  I think the lens may be out of alignment, because if you move it this way, the image turns fuzzy, see? But if you turn it ... the other way...everything becomes clear. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar.</p>
                    
                    <p>This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Yeah, sure, okay.</p>
