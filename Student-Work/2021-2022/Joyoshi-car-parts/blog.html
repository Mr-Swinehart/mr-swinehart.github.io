        What if I don't? (Biff pulls out the gun and points it at Marty.) Lead poisoning. What about the police, Biff? They're gonna match up the bullet with that gun. (He looks down again.) Kid, I own the police! Besides, they couldn't match up the bullet that killed your old man.(laughs) C'mon, Doc, did you see the way she was looking at you? Well, she did have quite a scare, right? After all, Miss Clayton almost ended up at the bottom of Clayton Ravine. (he stops as he realizes what he just said) Clayton Ravine... Holy crap! Hey Doc! Clayton Ravine was named after a teacher. They say she fell in there a hundred years ago. A hundred years ago! That's this year! Every kid in school knows that story because we all have teachers we'd like to see fall into the ravine.

        Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Get your meat hooks off of me. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, (Biff stands up and he's at least a foot taller than Marty) uh please. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a… (spots Strickland over Marty's shoulder) since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. (Street) (Railroad Tracks - 1985) (The Delorean pops out of nowhere onto the tracks. Marty waves, sheepishly to the cars who are stopped on either side of the tracks. Suddenly there is a modern day train whistle. Marty looks up and stares, mortified, as he sees a huge freight that is about to collide with the Delorean.) Crap! (Just in time he manages to open the car door and stumble out.) AHHH!!! (He is still in the air when the Delorean is hit by the train and is reduced to a million little pieces. The train moves on. Marty goes over to where the car used to be, staring as the time circuit boards flicker one last time before they go dead forever.) Well, Doc, it's destroyed. He lifts his head. Just like you wanted.
