                <div id="box1" class="col-md-3">You'll find out in thirty years. It's about the future, isn't it? Wait a minute. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it.
                </div>
                <div id="box2" class="col-md-3">(The man points the gun and fires. He severs the rope that is holding Marty up and Marty falls to the ground taking a very deep breath. The gang looks at the man for the first time and raise their guns.) It'll shoot the fleas off a dogs back at 500 yards, Tannen, and its pointed straight at your head!! (Tannen motions to his gang and they all lower their guns.) You owe me money, blacksmith. How do ya figure?
                </div>
                <div id="box3" class="col-md-3">They're in your suede jacket, honey. (She is the first to notice Marty.) Marty. We thought you went to the lake. You wore that to the lake? Thank God you guys are all back to normal. Hey Marty, who're you supposed to be, Clint Eastwood? Right. I gotta go get Jennifer. (He gets into his truck.)
                </div>
                <div id="box4" class="col-md-3">(to kid) Excuse me. (he shoves the kid out of the way and kisses Loraine.) (Marty comes back and both his brother and sister show up in the picture again.) Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Uh, well, I gotta go. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks.

                <p class="text-info">Of course they run. But for recreation, for fun. Run for fun? Ha-ha, what kind of fun is that? (Another old man begins to laugh.) (Blacksmith Shop) (Marty arrives in town. He jumps off his horse and runs into Doc's shop.)Emmett! (Marty is keeping his eye on the speedometer and talking to himself.) Come on, come on. (He suddenly screams into the walkie-talkie.) You better hold on to something, Doc, the yellow log's about to blow!!! (There is a big explosion and Clara is shown, stunned, as she was thrown back a little on the car she was climbing on.) Ahh! Golly.</p>
               
               <br>
               
               <p>No, no, no, no, no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids! (The DeLorean) (Inside Marty and Jennifer are seated in the passenger seat while Doc is driving.) Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.</p>
               
               <br>
               
               <p>(to George) Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? (George grabs his bike and rides off.) Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. (Bedroom) (Marty jerks awake. He's in a bed in a darkened room. He hears someone moving around.) Mom, is that you? There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.</p>
               
               <br>
               
               <p>(Marty and Doc walk up to the school.) Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. This sounds pretty heavy. Weight has nothing to do with it.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-4 text-info bg-dark">Maggie. (Slams a dead deer down on the table.) I got supper. (Later) (Seamus and Marty are sitting at the table while Maggie tends to them.) I'm not one to pry into a man's personal affairs but how is it that you came to be way out here, without a horse? Or boots? Or a hat? Well my car - horse broke down and a bear ate my boots. And I guess I just forgot my hat.</div>
                
                <div class="col-sm-4 text-warning bg-primary">Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Mondayâ€¦ Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen.</div>
                
                <div class="col-sm-4 text-primary bg-warning">Right. (All of a sudden all the clocks in the room begin going off. It's very loud.) Are those my clocks I hear? Yeah, it's 8:00. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.</div>

                <div class="col-md-6">(The music begins. Doc and Marty stand off to the side and watch.) What great music! Yeah; it's got a beat and you can dance to it! (os) Step right up, gentlemen, and test your mettle with the latest products from Colonel Samuel Colt's Patent firearms of Hartford, Connecticut. Take this model for example. (Marty turns and watches the gun demonstration.) The new, improved and refined Colt Peacemaker. Available to you tonight for the low, low price of $12. (Doc spots Clara talking with some people and he smiles. Clara looks up and sees him and she smiles back. She walks over to him.)Leave Dad? Marty, are you feeling OK? Marty! No! no, I'm not feeling all right! I don't understand one damn thing that's going on around here and why nobody can give me a simple straight answer. (He sits down next to her.) Oh, they must have hit you on the head hard this time. (She runs her hand through her son's hair.) Mom, I just want to know one thing. (He holds her hand.) Where's my father? Where's George McFly? Marty! George, your father is in the same place he's been for the past 12 years. (takes a sip) Oak Park Cemetery.
