    <p id="desc4">(Marty takes off running and reaches the Mall just as his other self sees Doc get shot.) No, bastards. (The other Marty jumps into the Delorean and takes off.) Go. (w.t) Where's the book? (v.o) I dunno, Biff must still have it with him, all I have is the cover. (Strickland’s Office) (v.o) But where's Biff? (Outside, Biff has confronted George.)What is it, what's the matter Doc? For a moment, I thought I saw a taxi in my rear display. I thought it was following us. Weird. (Hilldale – McFly Residence) (Lorraine is changing the scenery on the window.) I can't believe this window is still broken. (She changes it from an Eastern garden to a sunset to New York at night to a mountain.)

Pretty tough hombre when you're pointin' a scattergun at a man's back.I'm old! (Both faint, but luckily Doc is there to catch 1985 Jennifer.)
