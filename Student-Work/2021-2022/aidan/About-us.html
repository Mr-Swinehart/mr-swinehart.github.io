        <p id="desc1"> (They cover the Delorean with a sheet and Doc opens the door. Lorraine walks in a little nervously until she spots Marty.) Hi, Marty. Uh, Loraine. How did you know I was here? I followed you. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.(He points behind Biff. Biff looks, and Marty throws the matchbox tray at him. It hits the chair just about Biff's head. Marty runs off. Biff turns back and sees him go. He fires at Marty and misses.) You're dead, you little son of a woman! (Biff presses a button which calls for security.) Wait a minute. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. No, I refuse to except the responsibility. (Doc rips up the letter.)I'm young! I'm old! (Both faint, but luckily Doc is there to catch 1985 Jennifer.) (Outside) (Biff arrives back in 2015 and parks the DeLorean. He gets out, clutching his chest. Doc calls to Marty.) </p>

        <p id="desc1">(Marty stares after the gun salesman dumbfounded.) Thanks again. (Marty walks the other direction and runs into Maggie and Seamus. Maggie is carrying William. They continue along together.) You had him, Mr. Eastwood! You could have just walked away, and nobody would o' thought the less o' ya for it. All it would have been was words... hot air from a buffoon. Instead you let him rile ya...rile ya into playing his game, his way, playing his rules. Seamus, relax, I know what I'm doing.(Marty thinks it's George, but is surprised when the car door is jerked open and Biff drags him out of the car.) You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Stop it.(still half-asleep) Mom? Mom, is that you? Just relax Marty. You've been asleep for almost two hours. I had a horrible nightmare. It was terrible. Well, you're safe and sound now. Back on the good ol' 27th floor. (Marty, now wide awake, sits up suddenly! Lorraine turns on the lights.)Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricityâ€¦ What did I just say? (Marty rewinds the tape and plays it again.)</p>

        <p id="desc1">(o.s) I don't know Needles. (o.s) What are you afraid of? (Den) If this thing works, it'll solve all your financial problems. And if it doesn't work Needles, I could get fired. It's illegal! I mean, what if the Jitz is watching, huh?Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait a minute, what are you doing in my room? Mom, Dad, help me! Wait a minute, wait a minute, OK, OK! (The door bursts open and Loretta's Dad enters. He's carrying a baseball bat.)Definitely, although not for another 84 years and not on trains. We'll have space vehicles Yes! There are now 2 of me here... </p>
