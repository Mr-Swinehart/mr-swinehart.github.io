You've been asleep for almost two hours. I had a horrible nightmare. It was terrible. Well, you're safe and sound now. Back on the good ol' 27th floor. (Marty, now wide awake, sits up suddenly! Lorraine turns on the lights.)

He picks up a bottle of car wax. Suddenly Biff pops up from the other side of the car.) Hey butthead! Get away from… Watch it, Biff. (Biff's tone instantly changes.)

They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph.

It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand?</div>

(He suddenly screams into the walkie-talkie.) You better hold on to something, Doc, the yellow log's about to blow!!!

We've got a mission to accomplish! (He runs to the end of the alleyway and uses this gadget. Cut to a street. Doc looks at a woman walking down it, then Marty McFly Jr. walks past her. Doc uses the gadget to watch Marty Junior, who looks almost like his father aged 17 (ie 1985 Marty) walk into a futuristic 'phone box.) Precisely on schedule. (Cut back to Marty.)

(DeLorean) (w.t) Then get out of there! (v.o) No Doc, not me, the other me, the one's that's up on stage playing Johnny B Goode! (w.t) Great Scott! Your other self will miss the lightning bolt at the clock tower, you won't get back to the future and we'll have a major paradox!2... You better get out there son - I got $20 goin' betting on ya so you can't let me down. I got $30 goin' betting against you so don't let ME down. 3...4... You better face up to it son, because if you don't go out there...

    (Marty spots his dad's bike leaning up against a tree, and looks up to see his father in the tree looking through a pair of binoculars. He looks to see what his father is looking at and sees a half-undressed girl through a bedroom window.) He's a peeping tom. (George falls out of the tree and is about to be hit by an oncoming car.) Dad! (Marty shoves him out of the way and gets hit by the car himself.) (to George) Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? (George grabs his bike and rides off.) Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. (Bedroom) (Marty jerks awake. He's in a bed in a darkened room. He hears someone moving around.)I want ever'-body to know that the gun that shot Buford Tannen was a Colt Peacemaker. Hey, hey, thanks. Of course, you understand that if you lose...I'm taking it back. (He smiles and walks away.) (Marty stares after the gun salesman dumbfounded.) Thanks again.Yeah, well history is gonna change. (Auditorium - After school) (Marty's band is getting ready to try out.) Next, please. Alright, we're the Pinheads.I don't worry. (she leans over and kisses him, then leans back with a weird look on her face.) This is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Someone's coming. (Marty thinks it's George, but is surprised when the car door is jerked open and Biff drags him out of the car.) You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him.Mom? (o.s) Such a sweet girl. (Living Room) (Jennifer sees her future son sit down in front of the TV. A painting is on display.) Marty Jr.Put it off. (The picture vanishes) OK, I want channels 18, 24, 63, 109, 87 and the Weather Channel.(We cut to the garage, where Marty is listening.) (v.o) When are you coming home? The dance! I'll get home when I get home! (He enters the garage.) (Marty hides in the back of the car.)Power laces, all right! (He puts on the left shoe and it does the same thing. He then gets the jacket out of the bag and puts it on, but it’s too big. Doc comes running back towards Marty.) This thing doesn't fit. (Doc presses a button. The jacket modifies so it fits Marty.) (v.o) Size adjusting, fits. Pull out your pants pockets. All kids in the future wear their pants inside out. (Marty does so. Doc goes back into the bag and pulls out a cap.) Put this on. (He puts it on Marty's head.) Perfect, you're the spitting image of your future son. What?Yes, well, I'm hoping to see some lightning tonight, although the weatherman says there is not going to be any rain. There's going to be plenty of rain all right. Wind, thunder, lightning. It's going to be one hell of a storm. Well, thanks. Nice talking to you. Maybe we'll bump into each other some time again in the future. Or in the past. (1985 Doc gets on his bike and ride off, ringing his bell. 1955 Doc looks up. That ring sounded very familiar!)Welcome home Jennifer. (Jennifer is about to walk out when she realizes that her future self has just walked in! 2015 Jennifer, has grey hair - the years have not been kind to her. She's carrying groceries. Both Jennifer’s stop and stare at each other.) I'm young! I'm old! (Both faint, but luckily Doc is there to catch 1985 Jennifer.)
