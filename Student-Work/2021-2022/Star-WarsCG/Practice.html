Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Actually, people call me Marty. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. (she gets up and goes to sit next to him) Do you mind if I sit here?</p>

No, it ain't homework, 'coz, uh, I'm ain't at home. (Biff chuckles. Strickland doesn't find it so amusing and pushes Biff.) You've got a real attitude problem, Tannen. Watch it! Or one day, I'll have you right where I want you, in detention. Slacker! (Strickland walks off. Marty follows him (Biff goes the other way). Strickland walks past the Packard, Marty freezes beside it.)</p>

                <div id="box3"class="col-lg-3"><p id="para-box-3">(points over at Lorraine's table.) Biff. (Biff is sitting at Lorraine's table, and he's trying to grope her.) C'mon, c'mon. Leave me alone. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you.Evening. You look very...nice. Thank you. Would you like...uh...would you care to, uh... I'd love to.Look Biff, someone already asked me to the dance. Who, that bug George McFly? I'm going with Calvin Klein, OK? Calvin Klein? (He grabs Lorraine by her shoulders and turns her to face him.) No, that's not OK. You're going with me, understand? Get your cooties off of me!</p>

                <div id="box4"class="col-lg-3"><p id="para-box-4">(to himself) Shark still looks fake. (A holo-billboard in the background “starts”.) Hi friends, Goldie Wilson III here for Wilson's hover-conversion systems.. You know, when my grandpa was mayor of Hill Valley, he had to worry about traffic problems. But now, you don't have to worry about traffic! I'll hover-convert your old road car into a skyway flyer. For only $39,999.95. So come on down and see me, Goldie Wilson III, at any one of our 29 convenient locations. Remember, keep 'em flying. (Blast from the Past) (Marty walks over to the Antique store and looks in the window. Inside are ‘Grey’s Sports Almanac 1950-2000, a JAWS Nintendo game, a Roger Rabbit doll, a lava lamp, a Dustbuster, a walkman, Animal House & Dragnet videos, and Marty’s shirt and jacket from Part I.)</p>

The horses make a sudden turn and the wagon falls into the Ravine.) (stopping his horse) Whoa. Yeah. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. (he takes George over to where Lorraine is at her locker.) Lorraine. (surprised) Calvin. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.

I've wanted to do that my whole life! (Marty laughs.) (Later)I adore Jules Verne. So do I. 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, my absolute favorite. The first time I read that when I was a little boy I wanted to meet Captain Nemo and... (laughing) Please, Emmett...you couldn't have read that when you were a little boy, it was only first published ten years ago. (quickly covering up his mistake) Oh, yes, well...</p>

(Blacksmith Shop) (Marty arrives in town. He jumps off his horse and runs into Doc's shop.)Emmett! (Marty is keeping his eye on the speedometer and talking to himself.) Come on, come on. (He suddenly screams into the walkie-talkie.) You better hold on to something, Doc, the yellow log's about to blow!!! (There is a big explosion and Clara is shown, stunned, as she was thrown back a little on the car she was climbing on.) Ahh! Golly.</p>

               <p>No, no, no, no, no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids! (The DeLorean) (Inside Marty and Jennifer are seated in the passenger seat while Doc is driving.) Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.</p>

Come on out here, help me take him in the house. (Bedroom) (Marty jerks awake. He's in a bed in a darkened room. He hears someone moving around.) Mom, is that you? There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.</p>

               <p>(Marty and Doc walk up to the school.) Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. This sounds pretty heavy. Weight has nothing to do with it.</p>

                    Uh, I think so. What did she say? (There's a knock at the door before Marty can answer. Doc goes to see who it is.) It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. (They cover the Delorean with a sheet and Doc opens the door. Lorraine walks in a little nervously until she spots Marty.)(w.t) Doc, dammit, come in. (v.o) Marty, what's up? (w.t) Doc, Doc, I'm in trouble, I blew it! (Lyon Estates) (w.t) Where's the book?(Train Station) Ma'am. How far does the 8:00 train go? San Francisco's the end of the line. I'll take a one way ticket.(w.t) Right Doc, let's get our asses back to the future... (Lightning strikes, bringing down a tree.) Doc, Doc, are you OK? (DeLorean) (w.t) That was a close one Marty, I almost bought the farm! (Street) (w.t) Be careful, you don't want to get struck by lightning-Don't you get it? You could make a fortune with this book, let me show you. (2015 Biff turns on the radio. During the following he's looking through the sports almanac to find the result.) (v.o) UCLA trail 17 to 16! It's 4th and 11 with only 18 seconds left of this game. I'd say it's all over for UCLA! Bet you a million bucks UCLA win at 19 to 17. What, are you deaf old man? He just said it was over! You lost!You sure you're not after bringing a curse on this house, taking him in like that. Such a strange young man. Aye, but I've just got a feeling about him Maggie. It's the right thing to do. It's important. Look how the baby takes to him. Little Will never takes to strangers. It's almost as if...he's connected to us. (Kitchen Table) (talking to William) Hey, Will. So you're my great-great-great-grandfather Naruto...the first McFly born in America. I really like that hat, Marty. Thanks, Biff. (Jennifer's House) (Marty pulls up outside of Jennifer's house. Jennifer is still sleeping on the swing on the porch.) Jennifer. Jen. Jennifer. Wake up.7... Here...(He slides a gun across the table.) 8... I already got a gun. (He passes it back to the man.) 9...Then you know what happened to him? You know what happened, March 15th 1973? Yes Marty, I know. (Doc’s Garage) (It’s a mess. Doc opens a book. ‘Hill Valley Telegraph Archives March 1st - April 30th 1973’. On the page he turns to is a headline – “Local Author Shot Dead.” We stay focused on the paper as Doc speaks.) (v.o) I went to the public library to try and make sense out of all the madness. The place was boarded up, shut down, so I broke in and borrowed some newspapers.But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. (He runs inside his house and shuts the door behind him.) (to himself) Science Fiction Theater.What? The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social… What, well you mean like a date? Right. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties?            </div>
