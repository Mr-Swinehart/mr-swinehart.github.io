                     WRITTEN BY ANISTON WAUGH<br>APRIL 21, 2022 <br>Mom, Dad. (he falls over) Marty, are you alright? Did you hurt your head? (Marty gets back up.) You guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.Wait. Let's just think this thing through logically. We know it can't run on its own power, and we know we can't pull it. But, if we can figure out a way to push it up to 88 mph...huh? (Suddenly the train whistle blows outside. Doc turns and looks out the window and sees the train.) That's it! (Train Station) (Marty and Doc are standing next to the train talking to the conductor.)(The police car takes off and passes Marty and Doc.) Let's go, I sure hope we find Jennifer before she finds herself! (He looks at a sign which gives information on the skyway. It says "Skewed on Skyway C25".) , the skyway's jammed, it's going to take us forever to get there. (Almanac) And this stays here, I didn't invent the time machine to win at gambling, I invented the time machine to travel through time! I know, I know Doc! (Doc puts the almanac on a barrel and the two leave. Unknown to them, Biff has been overhearing! He opens a door to see the almanac and picks it up.) So, Doc Brown invented a time machine.(Marty and Doc walk up to the school.) Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they </p>

    HOW IT'S GOING
    </h1><p class="blog-2">WRITTEN BY ANISTON WAUGH<br>MAY 2, 2022 <br>That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. This sounds pretty heavy. Weight has nothing to do with it(The police car takes off and passes Marty and Doc.) Let's go, I sure hope we find Jennifer before she finds herself! (He looks at a sign which gives information on the skyway. It says "Skewed on Skyy C25".) , the skyway's jammed, it's going to take us forever to get there. (Almanac) And this stays here, I didn't invent the time machine to win at gambling, I invented the time machine to travel through time! I know, I know Doc!

    OUR GOAL
    </h1><p class=blog-3> WrITTEN BY ANISTON WAUGH<br>MAY 6, 2022 <br>(moves off) Well, I guess Miss Clayton will have to find other transportation. Turning to face Marty. If I never meet the woman, there's no possibility of a romantic infatuation, right? You're the doc, Doc. Alright then. Let's get the Delorean and get ourselves back to the future! (casually) Oh Doc, I tore a hole in the gas tank. We'll have to patch it up and get gas. (Freezes in place) You mean we're out of gas?fer before she finds herself!
