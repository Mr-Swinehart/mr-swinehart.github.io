    <strong>Dauntless is a fun and enjoyable PvE monster-hunting game. Everything is in third person view. There are a few main things to know about Dauntless: The elements, the gliders, parrying/interrupting, the weapon types, and the omnicells.<br></strong>
    <br>
    <strong>Starting off with the elements of Dauntless. There are seven in total, with a rumored 2 more to come to the game. The seven that are currently in the game are Blaze, Frost, Terra, Shock, Umbral, Radiant, and neutral. The elements in Dauntless don't all have different weakenss, they are all weak to their pair. Blaze is weak to Frost and vice versa. Terra and Shock are weak to eachother. And then Umbral and Radiant are weak to eachother. Neutral has no weakness but no strength. Here are some baasic things to expect with each element of behemoth.<br>
        <br></strong>
    <strong>Blaze</strong> - Mostly larger, primitive looking behemoths (dinosaurs, primeapes, etc) Many AOE (Area Of Effect) attacks that give burn once they hit.<br><br>
    <strong>Frost</strong> - Varying designs, Almost all of them are some color of white or blue. Varying amounts of AOE and physical attacks. One thing that remains consistent is the freeze debuff (slows and reduces stamina)<br><br>
    <strong>Terra</strong> - Almost always look like rocks or plants. Almost only physical and close ranged attacks. Cannot inflict any status effects. <br><br>
    <strong>Shock</strong> - Mostly blue, white, turqoise, or yellow. Almost exclusively precise ranged attacks, very few physical attacks. Can inflict shock (interact disabled, no dodge, directions scrambled)<br><br>
    <strong>Umbral</strong> - Only black, purple, and pink. Mostly shadowy appearances, sometimes look like a raven or dark creature. An unholy strong mix of physical and ranged attacks. Can inflict void burn (DoT, slowed movement, lowered stamina, increased damage intake.)<br><br>
    <strong>Radiant</strong> - Mostly white, pink, or bright colors. Mostly creatures associated with light, sometimes mystical creatures. Only precise and AOE ranged attacks. Beams, explosions, light shields, and random teleportation. Can inflict blindness (Slowed movement, blank screen, blurred screen when vision is restoring.)<br><br>
    <strong>Neutral</strong> - Mostly the weakest creatures. Look mostly like rodents or simple animals. All of them are dull colors. Almost always physical attacks, only one has a ranged attack. Cannot inflict any status effects.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Gliders are an important part of the game's movement and exploration. Certain gliders take less stamina, some go faster than others, and some can boost you higher into the air. Always watch your stamina bar, or else you will fall. Almost always invest in a glider than can launch you into the air, you may need it if you need to make a quick escape.<br><br></strong>
        
    Another important part of the game is interrupting and parrying. These allow you to get a clear shot at the behemoth. Parrying is the better option, as it allows you to instantly deal damage, interrupt, and avoid all damage from the behemoth. Here are ways to interrupt or parry.<br><br>
    <strong>Interrupt</strong>: Wait for the behemoth to rear back for an attack, and land your attack right as the head of the behemoth glows. Interrupting does not grant stun for stun bounties.<br><br>
    <strong>Parrying</strong>: Only three things in the game let you parry. First, the Discipline omnicell. Second, the Twin Sun repeaters. And third, the Umbral Pact omnicell.<br><br>
    Weapons are a major part of the game. You need them to fight the behemoth. Here are the 7 kinds: Chain Blades, Swords, Axes, Hammers, Repeaters, War Pikes, and Aether Strikers.<br><br>
    <strong>Chain Blades</strong> - Fast and dangerous, close ranged, wound damage, closes gaps with chain pull.<br><br>
    <strong>Swords</strong> - Jack-of-all-trades, all ranges, basic damage<br><br>
    <strong>Axes</strong> - Close and medium range, high damage output but slow, wound and part damage, buff for every bar filled (stacks to 3x damage)<br><br>
    <strong>Hammers</strong> - All ranges, heavy attacks, slow, some ranged attacks, part and stagger damage.<br><br>
    <strong>Repeaters</strong> - Medium to long range, light but fast damage, no interrupting attacks, part and normal damage.<br><br>
    <strong>War Pikes</strong> - All ranges, heavy and light attacks, long range attacks, all attacks can interrupt, can grant damage buffs, all damage types (wound, part, stagger).<br><br>
    <strong>Aether Strikers</strong> - Close to long range, super light and fast attacks, faster dodge, combo based, instant dodge (has cooldown).<br><br>
        
    <strong>The omnicells are the most crucial parts of any build. The omincell you should choose should be the one that best compliments your skills and what stats your armor has.<br><br></strong>
    
    <strong>Bastion</strong> - Best for high defense and health builds.<br>
        All shield gains increased by 15%, gain shields with each hit.<br>
        Leap forward and slam the ground, consuming all shields, dealing damage equal to 150% of current shields.<br><br>
        
    <strong>Iceborne</strong> - Best for lifesteal builds or low defense builds.<br>
        Increase max health by 100, gain 1% lifesteal, taking damage reduces ability cooldown<br>
        Throw an ice spike that deals 1500 frost damage; double damage if at max health, immune to stagger, increase lifesteal to 10% for 8 seconds.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Discipline</strong> - Best for high-health builds, high-speed builds, and high-damage builds.<br>
        Increased critical chance, increased damage, healing reduced by 50%. <br>
        Quick parrying punch (can interrupt) Increases damage by 300%, increases damage intake by 100%.<br><br>
        
    <strong>Tempest</strong> - Best for shock builds, high-speed builds, and stun-builds.<br>
        Increased attack speed. Dodging grants Velocity. Each Velocity increases movement speed. Velocity can stack<br>
        Consume a stack of Velocity to dash and deal 450 damage. for every stack, increase damage by 10%.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Revenant</strong> - Strong for all builds except low-health builds.<br>
        Once Revenant state ends, each stack of void energy grants 115 health per second for 10 seconds.<br>
        Drain 500 health to enter revenant state and spawn a void orb. for every 100 health drained, summon a tendril that deals 700 damage. If a tendril hits a target, it spawns a void orb on impact. Picking up a void orb grants a stack of void energy, which gives extra damage and increases Revenant state.<br><br>
        
   <strong>Artificer</strong> - Decent omnicell, very specific, good in all builds but not super strong. 4 uses. <br>
        1 - revive an ally from far away, granting shield and health regen for you and your ally.<br>
        2 - Cleanse a targeted ally from all debuffs, and increase damage for 20 seconds.<br>
        3 - Mark a behemoth part to take extra damage from all sources for 15 seconds.<br>
        4 - Surround an area with a radiant wall, blocking all ranged behemoth attacks, increases all stats for 20 seconds.<br><br>
