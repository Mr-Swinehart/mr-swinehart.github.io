       WAHHHH!! HOT! HOT! (He runs out of the saloon and dunks his head into the water-filled horse trawl. He doesn't move. Marty and the bartender run out after him and look around, and spot him by the horse trawl. They lift him out of the water and look at his face.) He's still out! (as they drag Doc back into the saloon) Oh, that, that was just a reflex action. It's gonna take a few more minutes for the stuff to really clear up his head. Perfect.You're right. There's not much left. Doc's never comin' back. I'm sure gonna miss him, Jen. (He picks up a torn piece of paper from the mess. It's a picture, torn in half, of Doc at the clock tower in 1885. Suddenly the rail crossing bells start ringing. Marty and Jennifer back up off the tracks and look bother directions, but no train is coming. They look at each other, puzzled.) What the heck? (Suddenly there is a huge "boom" and Marty and Jennifer are thrown back. They land on the grass. A shiny train, with "ELB" written on the side, appears. Out of the cab window, Doc pops his head out.)(Strickland walks off.

       Just get in the car, butthead. Who are you calling butthead, butthead? (2015 Biff starts the car. 1955 Biff is surprised.) How did you know how to do that? Nobody could start this car but me. Just get into the car, Tannen. Today's your lucky day. (Tannen Residence) (The car, driven by 2015 Biff, drives up towards the garage. The backs of the heads of both Biffs are visible.)(v.o) Hey, hey, hey, hey, watch where you're going old man! If you break this car I'm gonna kill you! (The car enters the garage and 2015 Biff stops it. His face is visible, 1955 Biff is facing away.) This cost me 300 bucks!(Bedroom) (Marty jerks awake. He's in a bed in a darkened room. He hears someone moving around.) Mom, is that you? There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Hey man, the dance is over.

       (Marty drives Doc home in the rain following the lightening strike. He hangs up the letter from the Doc in 1885 by the fireplace to dry.) (The Next Morning) (Doc's House) (Marty is asleep in the chair. His feet are propped up using the hoverboard. Doc is still asleep on the couch. The TV is all snowy but suddenly the service starts working.) Hey kids what time is it? Howdy Doody time!EMMETT! (into walkie-talkie) Marty, are the time circuits on? (into walkie-talkie)Check, Doc. (into walkie-talkie) Input the destination time - October 27, 1985, 11 AM. (Marty punches this information into the keypad.)(v.o) UCLA trail 17 to 16! It's 4th and 11 with only 18 seconds left of this game. I'd say it's all over for UCLA! Bet you a million bucks UCLA win at 19 to 17. What, are you deaf old man? He just said it was over! You lost! Oh yeah? (He turns the volume up.) (v.o) Here comes Decker with the kick, it's up, it looks good folks, it looks very good, field goal! UCLA wins 19 to 17!(DeLorean) (Doc pulls out the newspaper he had. The headlines change from “Emmett Brown Committed” to “Emmett Brown Commended”, “Nixon To Seek Fifth Term” to “Reagan To Seek Second Term” and “Biffco Builds New Dioxin Plant” to “Mayor Wilson Vetoes Zoning Bill”.) (to himself) Mission accomplished.
