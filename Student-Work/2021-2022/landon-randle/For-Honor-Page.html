    <strong>For Honor is a third-person 3d fighting game. You can fight against other players and NPCs. There are certain heroes that you can choose, but each have their own category, which I will break down. There are also different kinds of attacks and movements that I will go over as well.<br></strong>
    <br><br>
    <strong>Every type class has its own advantages and disadvantages. Certain ones might be more combo based, but lack interrupting power. Others might be strong but lack combos and are extremely slow. Here is an overview of the different kinds of classes.</strong><br><br>
    <strong>Quick-Combo</strong> - Low damage. Up to 10 attack combos. Very fast and long lasting combos. Mainly rely on stat debuffs and bleed damage for a win.<br>
    <strong>Strong-Combo</strong> - Medium to heavy damage. 5 attack combos. slower than Quick-Combo, but still quick enough to confuse combatants. Can rely on bleed, more heavily rely on parrying.<br>
    <strong>Quick-Precision</strong> - Fast and precise attacks. Low damage if you're not aiming in the right spots. Rely on dodging and waiting for the right time to strike<br>
    <strong>Strong-Precision</strong> - Rather slow but precise attacks. 1-2 attack combos. Medium to heavy damage in any situation. Rely on parrying, dodging, and waiting for the right time to strike.<br>
    <strong>Heavy-No Combo</strong> - Slow but high damaging attacks. No combos. High health and bleed resistance. Rely on high health, tanking hits until you get a strike.<br>
    <strong>Heavy-Short Combo</strong> - Slow and short, but high damaging combos. Up to 2 attack combos. Some bleed resistance, decent health. Rely on tanking hits, parrying, and following through enemy attacks.
    <br><br>
    <strong>There are several kinds of movements and attacks in For Honor, each with their own ways of helping you win a fight. Unfortunately, while they are all available to use, many are harshly looked down upon by most of the community. Here is a list of the movements and attacks of For Honor.<br></strong>
    <br>
    <strong>Light Attack</strong> - Perform a quick and low damaging attack, dealing roughly 5-10 damage per hit. can be interrupted, short parry time. Takes minimal stamina.<br>
    <strong>Heavy Attack</strong> - Perform a slow and high damaging attack, dealing about 15-20 damage per hit. Cannot be interrupted, can be parried, medium parry time. Takes 1/8th of a stamina bar.<br>
    <strong>Unblockable Attack</strong> - Perform a medium speed attack, dealing anywhere between 5-15 damage. Cannot be blocked or interrupted, but can be parried with a very small parry window. Takes a quarter of a stamina bar per hit.<br>
    <strong>Unstoppable Attack</strong> - Perform a slow, low damaging attack, dealing between 10-20 damage. Cannot be parried, interrupted, or blocked. Uses a whole stamina bar for each hit. Missing your hit instantly sets up a combo for your enemy. (Only use if enemy is out of stamina or stunned)<br>
    <strong>Dodge</strong> - Perform a dodging maneuver, spending 1/5 or 1/8 of your stamina bar (depends on your hero's stamina stat). Will avoid damage if you dodged away from an enemy attack.<br>
    <strong>Guard Break</strong> - Quickly hit your enemy with the blunt part of your weapon, stunning and leaving them open to an attack. Deals no damage, but allows for an opening for a strong attack. (Looked down upon by many players).<br>
    <strong>Push Away</strong> - Used to avoid Guard Break stuns. Quicly push your enemy's weapon away from you and kick them backwards. Gives you space to move and plan your next action. Can be used to shove enemies off ledges. (looked down upon as well).<br>
    <strong>Block</strong> - Straightforward and simple. Block your enemy's attack, taking away some of your stamina with each hit.<br>
    <strong>Parry</strong> - Block towards your enemy's current stance, blocking right as their attack connects with you. Let's you avoid damage, stuns your opponent, and takes minimal stamina to perform.<br>
