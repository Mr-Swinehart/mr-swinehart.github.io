<h4 id="person_text">Two of them? (DeLorean) (Marty says hello to Einstein.) I left him in a suspended animation kennel. Einstein never knew I was gone! (gets out of the car) Marty! What in the name of Sir Isaac H Newton happened here? Oh yeah, Doc, listen, my kid showed up, all broke loose.Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. (Doc pulls his sunglasses down and hits a button. Suddenly the car is airborne. They take off into the future.) (Hill Valley – 1985) (We pick up where Part 1, left off. Marty opens the garage and inside is the Toyota truck he admired earlier. Marty walks up to it and looks inside. He slaps the door of the truck. Jennifer walks up behind him.) How about a ride, Mister?</h4>

<h4 id="person_text">Ohh, no. No, Doc. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. Yeah. (Down the Street)Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your Pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Uh, I think so. What did she say? (There's a knock at the door before Marty can answer. Doc goes to see who it is.) It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine.Calvin Klein? (He grabs Lorraine by her shoulders and turns her to face him.) No, that's not OK. You're going with me, understand? Get your cooties off of me! When are you going to get it through that thick skull of yours Lorraine, you're my girl! Biff Tannen, I wouldn't be your girl even if... (pause) even if you had a million dollars! (She kicks Biff in the leg.) Argh! (Then she hits him over the head with the box.) Oh! (Lorraine and Babs run off. Biff runs into the middle of the road, causing a car to swerve slightly to avoid hitting him.) Yes you will, Lorraine! It's you and me, Lorraine!</h4>

<h4 id="person_text">You do? You know what I do in those situations? What? I don't worry. (she leans over and kisses him, then leans back with a weird look on her face.) This is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense.(o.s) Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother! (1985 Marty creeps past the car unseen as we hear Lorraine and 1955 Marty speaking.) When I have kids, I'm going to let them do anything they want. Anything at all. (in the car) I'd like to have that in writing. (outside the car) Yeah, me too.</h4>

<h4 id="person_text">(Our Marty watches as the Delorean hits 88 MPH and takes off into the past. He runs over to Doc who is laying, unmoving, on the ground.) Doc, Doc. Oh, no. (The Doc sits up behind him. Marty turns and sees that Doc is alive.) You're alive. (Doc pulls down zipper on his jump suit to reveal a bullet proof vest.) Bullet proof vest? How did you know? (Doc pulls out the letter that has been taped back together.) I never got a chance to tell you. What about all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum? Well, I figured, what the. (Marty's House) (Doc has dropped Marty off.)</h4>
