THIRD-PARTY LINKS
        <br>
In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, BETTER CALL SIGLER may choose various third-party web sites to link to from its own site. However, even if the third party is affiliated with BETTER CALL SIGLER, BETTER CALL SIGLER has no control over these linked sites, all of which have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of BETTER CALL SIGLER. BETTER CALL SIGLER has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and therefore you access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, BETTER CALL SIGLER seeks to protect the integrity of its web site and the links placed upon it and therefore requests any feedback on not only its own site, but for sites it links to as well (including if a specific link does not work).
<br><br>
GIFT CARDS
        <br>
1. Purchasing Gift Cards. BETTER CALL SIGLER offers gift cards (“Gift Cards”) that can be purchased and redeemed through www.bettercallsigler.com. You must have an Account with BETTER CALL SIGLER to purchase or redeem Gift Cards; purchasing or redeeming Gift Cards constitutes acceptance of the BETTER CALL SIGLER Terms and Conditions. Unless expressly stated otherwise, Gift Cards will be provided in electronic form or by card. 
<br>
1.2 Redeeming Gift Cards. Gift Cards may only be redeemed through bettercallsigler.com and may not be redeemed towards previous purchases. Every purchase made with a Gift Card (plus any applicable shipping/handling fees, taxes, and other fees that may apply) is deducted from the Gift Card balance and any unused Gift Card balance will remain on the Gift Card account. Gift Card balances will be used against the total order placed on bettercallsigler.com and not against specific items of such order. If any purchase exceeds the Gift Card account, the balance must be paid with a credit card or any other payment method accepted by bettercallsigler.com.
<br>
1.3 Gift Card Account. The balance of a Gift Card can be reviewed by the purchaser or holder of the Gift Card by entering the respective Gift Card code into the form that is provided by BETTER CALL SIGLER for this purpose on the Website.
<br>
1.4 Restrictions. Promo Gift Cards cannot be combined with other Gift Cards, coupons, or other website promotions. Limit one promotional gift card or coupon per order. Multiple Gift Cards cannot be combined into a combined balance on one or more new Gift Cards and Gift Cards cannot be reloaded or recharged or redeemed together with a coupon or other Gift Cards for the same order. Except as expressly allowed by BETTER CALL SIGLER, Gift Cards may not be transferred for value or resold. Except to the extent required by applicable law, Gift Cards cannot be redeemed for cash or checks and Gift Card balances cannot be transferred to credit card accounts or accounts of other means of payment. If applicable law requires BETTER CALL SIGLER to redeem Gift Cards for cash, check, or other means of payment, BETTER CALL SIGLER reserves the right to select any of the foregoing at its discretion. Gift Cards can only be redeemed for purchases in the currency that matches the personal currency preferences set for the respective Account. BETTER CALL SIGLER reserves the right to reject the redemption of Gift Cards and request alternative forms of payment, terminate the respective Account, and take legal actions, if BETTER CALL SIGLER reasonably believes that Gift Cards are abused or used or obtained fraudulently.
<br>
1.5 Risk of Loss. The title and risk of loss for Gift Cards passes upon electronic transmission of the Gift Card by BETTER CALL SIGLER to the purchaser of the Gift Card. BETTER CALL SIGLER has no obligation to replace lost or stolen Gift Cards, but you can report lost or stolen Gift Cards by contacting Customer Support.
<br>
1.6 No expiration date or fees. Gift Cards have no expiration date and BETTER CALL SIGLER charges no fee in connection with the purchase (except for the selected purchase price of the Gift Card) or redemption of Gift Cards.</h6></center>
